        and initial testing.

FR:	WANPIPE Frame Relay API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid frame relay api development,
        and initial testing.

CHDLC:	WANPIPE CHDLC API sample programs. These programs
        should be used for rapid chlc api development,
        and initial testing.
