------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.4.0
Release date : July 1st 2005:
	The remote client version is 25.
------------------------------------
  Added Feature : 
	o The NOISE_REDUCTION_FOR_MIXING feature is added. This is a noise reduction algorithm that does not inject 
	  background noise. The intend is to mix music after this algorithm. It also attenuates greatly the 
 	  non-speech period for better mixing. If this algorithm is used alone (without later mixing), it will 
	  not give a good subjective quality.
	o Configurable gain adjustment for Automatic level control. There are 2 parameters : GAIN_RATE and LOSS_RATE.
          The parameter can only be changed at compilation time. 

  Removed Feature : 
	o The Sin energy is not calculated anymore when the RIN ANR feature is present.


  Bug Fix: 
	o The WIRELESS Image has a better support for Fax/Modem calls. 
	o The attenuation speed of the all level controls have changed. The attenuation speed is now uniform even 
          as we approach the targeted gain. 
	o When DTMFs were present on the line, a gain of +- 2dB was applied. It is now removed. 
	o The DTMF Tone Removal feature does not clip the 1100 Hz. 


  Known Issue: 
	o In A-law networks where the idle line pattern is not A-law silence (0x55 or 0xD5) DC offset removal must be enabled 
	  in order for 2100Hz guard band to be detected correctly in order for echo cancellation to be re-enabled 
	  at the end of a data transmission.


------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.3.4
Release date : March 16 2005:
	The remote client version is 25.
------------------------------------
  Added Feature : 
	o The Playout stop and stop immediately functions have been modified so that there is no longer a need 
	  for the host cpu to wait 8ms before playing the next event.

  Bug Fix: 
	o Better support for low speed fax/modems that which do not respect ITU-T V.25 (ie. without 2100Hz disabling tone).
	o The calculation of the Rin and Sout energy level has been modified. The statistics now represent the 
	  average energy of the signal over the last 256ms.

  Known Issue: 
	o In A-law networks where the idle line pattern is not A-law silence (0x55 or 0xD5) DC offset removal must be enabled 
	  in order for 2100Hz guard band to be detected correctly in order for echo cancellation to be re-enabled 
	  at the end of a data transmission.
	o When doing ALC, ALE, NLE on the Sout port in an acoustic environment, the energy target may not always be valid
	  and may be off by a few dBoV. 
	  This will be fixed in a future release.
	o Statistics for Rin Energy and Sout Energy will not work with API versions earlier than 01.00-PR33.
	o When using the DTMF Tone Removal feature, if a 1100Hz tone is sent on the Sin-Sout port, it will be clipped. This will 
	  be fixed in a future release.


------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.3.3
Release date : January 24 2005:
	The remote client version is 25.
------------------------------------
  Added Feature : 
	o Per channel, configurable tail length. Minimum value is 32ms and maximum value is 128 ms. 
	o Per channel, configurable ANR settings added (ANR Segregation and ANR Signal to noise ratio improvement).
	o Per channel, configurable speech recognition user mode at build time (allow user to enable or disable the feature).
	o Per channel, configurable Rin Tone Removal feature. 
	o Per channel, configurable Rin noise reduction feature (allow user to enable or disable the feature).
	o Per channel, configurable new acoustic echo algorithm for non-linear echo points (allow user to enable or disable the feature).
	o Per channel, configurable Octasic music protection feature (allow user to enable or disable the feature).
	o Per chip, at build time VAD sensitivity thresholds.
	o Added Extensive external memory BIST that can be done at boot for production requirement. 


	Please refer to OCT6100 document for feature availability by product number.

  Bug Fix: 
	o Per channel, during a Fax Relay call VQE features can be reenable only after a configurable period of silence.
	o Remaining issues after 0xFFFF echo point changes have been solved in 01.03.03.
	o In some cases, activating the NLE could modify the gain on the Rout port

  Known issue : 
	o After opening a channel it will take 40ms before it is ready to start playing-out a buffer. 
      	  This is due to the setup time of the NLP when a channel is opened. 
	o In A-law networks where the idle line pattern is not A-law silence (0x55) DC offset removal must be enabled in order for 2100Hz guard band 
	  to be detected correctly in order for echo cancellation to be re-enabled at the end of a data transmission.
	o In Fax Relay Calls with long delays when only 1 echo canceller is present in the network, and the non echo cancelled echo point is strong, there might be
	  some call failure. This will be fixed in the next release 01.03.04.
	o When doing ALC, ALE, NLE on the Sout port in an acoustic environment, the energy target will not always be valid. 
	  This will be fixed in the next release 01.03.04 	

	o ALC after 2100Hz
		With Firmware Version 1.3.0, 1.3.1, 1.3.3 without Idle Code Detection, the ALC will not be able to change the gain applied until the channel is reset.
		With Firmware Version 1.3.3 with Idle Code Detection, the ALC will not be able to change the gain applied between the maximum of 1.5 s and X ms of silence, where X is given by the user in the “ulToneDisablerVqeActivationDelay”  field.
		With Firmware Version 1.3.4, the ALC will not be able to change the gain applied until X ms of silence, where X is given by the user in the “ulToneDisablerVqeActivationDelay” field.

	o The tail displacement in version 1.3.3 and greater is incompatible with API versions earlier than 01.00-PR30


------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.3.1.1
Release date : September 24th 2004
	The remote client version is 24.
------------------------------------
	o This version is exactly the same as 1.3.1 except that IDLE detection and reset has been removed because it caused a problem where noise could be generated after a channel is IDLE for a long time.
	  See errata oct6100er-011204 for more information.

------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.3.1
Release date : September 24th 2004
	The remote client version is 24.
------------------------------------
	
	o Tone Removal Feature: The algorithm has been improved to react within 16 ms when a DTMF is detected on the line. Note that this feature is 
	  part of the conferencing suite of features. This feature should not be enabled with fax or modem calls. 
	o Added Advanced listener enhancement feature : This determines by how many dB the user wants the SIN voice to be above the RIN noise. 
	  This value is set and enabled in API on a per channel basis. 
	o Added Natural listener enhancement feature : This will automatically apply a gain on the SOUT signal such that it matches the RIN voice. 
          This feature is enabled in the API on a per channel basis. 
	o Added Rout ANR feature : Noise reduction on the Rin-Rout path. 
	  This feature is enabled in the API on a per channel basis. 
	o Added support for 31 or 127 events of playout queuing at the same time. Previously, the number of playout events was 127 only. This feature 
	  allows the customer to save external memory space for playout (used by the playout events).

	o Added feature for VAD, to allow strong stationary signal (like tone or DTMF) to be detected as voice. Configurable on image build. 
	o Added mute support for both direction, Sin and Rin. Previously, this was done in the API. 
	o Added to the ALC algorithm a noise floor so that the algorithm does not adapt to very low voice signal. These low voice signals are 
	  considered to be intentional by the user (like whispering). Configurable on image build. 
	o Added new hardware chip bist on boot up.
	o Z VAD will work only if the RIN ANR is enabled.

  Fix bug : 
	o Convergence problem for tail displacement above 384 ms.
	o Echo point changes could not be detected by the chip after 0xFFFF echo point changes. 

  Known issue : 
	o After opening a channel it will take 40ms before it is ready to start playing-out a buffer. 
      	  This is due to the setup time of the NLP when a channel is opened. 
	o In A-law networks where the idle line pattern is not A-law silence (0x55) DC offset removal must be enabled in order for 2100Hz guard band 
	  to be detected correctly in order for echo cancellation to be re-enabled at the end of a data transmission.


------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.3.0
Release date : May 6th 2004
	The remote client version is 23.
------------------------------------
  Added features : 
	o Added Idle Code detection. The chip will reset after either 
		- 1 second of idle pattern in both direction
		- 1 second of silence in both direction
	o Both AEC and tail displacement at the same time are now supported.
	o AEC has now a configurable tail length and configurable default ERL value.
	o Automatic level control (G.169) is now supported.
	o High level control is now supported. High level control consist of settting a maximum threshold value in dBm0 
	  so that the signal does not exceed this threshold value. 
	o 127 events (instead of 31) of playout are now supported.
	o Wide band 2100Hz detection now supported. 
	o VQE only mode now supported. This will disable echo cancellation and allow all other VQE functions to work 
	  (ANR, ALC, HLC, Tone detection, Conferencing, Playout)
	
  Fixed Bugs : 
	o Removed tone refresh events for 1100Hz

  Known Issue : 
	o After 0xFFFF echo point changes detected by the chip without resetting the channel, the AF will not be able to find a new convergence in certain conditions.
          This bug has been fixed in 01.03.01.
	o Convergence problem will occur if tail displacement is above 384 ms

Release date : April 26th 2004
	The remote client version is 22. 
------------------------------------
  Added features : 
	o Illegals instruction occuring in the processor are loged and the processor is restore to normal
	  operation afterward.
	o Added the Music Protection
	o Added new features to Buffer playout ( API parameters : ulRepeatCount and ulDuration)
	o Added support to longer tail displacement.
	o Added tail displacement per channel.

  Bug Fixes : 
	o When setting the NLP to disable and resetting it to enable a transition period appears 
	  where the signal is attenuated (known as Whoosh bug).
	o The bug related to extended background noise (see 01.02.01) is fixed.

  Known issue : 
	o The channel operation mode in freeze does not support buffer playout. 
	o When doing buffer playout, if the channel is changed, the buffer playout must be restarted.
	o Dominant speaker (conferencing) does not work when in G169_ALC mode.

Release date : March 29th 2004
	The remote client version is 22. 
------------------------------------
  Added features : 
	o The required disabling tone 2100Hz is detected in the tolerance region as defined in G.168. 
          However, the firmware does not disabled itself in this firmware release. This will be added in the release 01.02.02.	  

  Known issue : 
	o In this version, the feature extended background noise is not supported and will not work. 
	  G.168 Test 9 is not supported in this version of firmware. It will be availabe in next release of firmware 01.02.02.




------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.2.0  
Release date : March 26th 2004
	The remote client version is 22. 
------------------------------------

 - Added features : 
	o NLP_BEHAVIOUR_B per channel:
		This feature allows the user to adjust and optimize the behavior of the echo 
		canceller in the presence of non-linear spectrally rich distortion on the 
		echo cancelled path.     
	o Adjustable tail length per image release :
		Adjustable tail length for each image release (up to the maximum value supported). 
		This modification is done in the firmware and cannot be changed by the user. 
		The adjustable tail length supported range from 32 ms to 128 ms by step of 4 ms. 
	o Recording length up to 2 minutes with the remote_client : 	
		Now support long recording length (up to 2 minutes) and short recording length (16 seconds). 
		The short recording length is by default on all releases. 
		The long recording length is defined in the firmware. 
		The values are : 16, 32,60 and 120 seconds. 

 - BUG Fixes:  
	o Multiple echo points :
     		In version 01.01.00, in some cases the convergence wasn't optimal. Now fixed in 01.02.00
	o G.168 Test 2A, Test 5 and Test 3C in PCM A-Law:
     		In version 01.01.00 when performing test in PCM A-Law G.168 tests 2A and 3C sometimes failed. Now fixed in 01.02.00
	o V.21 Modems :
     		In version 01.01.00, in some network configurations where the remote and local echo paths are very asymetrical V.21 calls
     		may fail to connect. This only happens in cases of echo points of 6dB and infinite ERL on the other side. Now fixed in version 01.02.00

  - Known issue : 
	o G.168 Test 9 is not supported in this version of firmware. It will be availabe in next release of firmware 01.02.02.
	  Setting the feature extended background noise to TRUE will cause an illegal instruction in the firmware of the NLP. 


------------------------------------
OCT6100 Firmware Release 1.1.0 
Release date : November 5th 2003
	The remote client version is 21. 
------------------------------------
     - Added features : 
	o Tone removal Enable (bit): 
		This function is used in conferencing applications where a user is sending commands to the bridge 
		using DTMF tones. After detection, the OCT6100 replaces the DTMF with background noise.
	o Non-Linearity A :  
		This feature allows the user to adjust and optimize the behavior of the echo canceller in the presence 
		of non-linear white distortion on the echo cancelled path. For example, if ADPCM is present on the 
		path, adjusting this parameter will reduce the amount of residual echo. 
	o Default ERL :
		By adjusting this parameter, the echo canceller performance can be improved during the convergence 
		period (<1s) if the ERL of the echo cancelled path is excessively high. 
	o Detection of the 1100Hz tone :
		The detection of 1100Hz tone allows the gateways that integrate the OCT6100 to take appropriate action
		in the presence of fax calls.
	
     - Bug Fixes :
      	o Fixed Buffer Playout problem where a delay had to be inserted between the opening of a channel and the playing 
      	out of a buffer.
      	o SS5 and SS6 COT tones sometimes not detected correctly.
      	
     - Known Issues (All will be fixed in the next firmware release):
     	o G.168 Test 2A, 5 and 3C:
     		When performing test in PCM A-Law G.168 tests 2A, 5 and 3C sometimes fail.
     	o Multiple echo points :
     		When multiple echo points are present, the convergence may not be optimal.
     	o V.21 Modems :
     		In some network configurations where the remote and local echo paths are very asymetrical V.21 calls
     		may fail to connect. This only happens in cases of echo points of 6dB and infinite ERL on the other side.
     	o CRC errors when opening channels :
     		CRC errors are detected when a channel is opened. This has no effect on voice quality.
	o Following a 2100Hz without phase reversal call, some residual echo might occur for half a second on the following call,
		 even if the channel has been reset.
