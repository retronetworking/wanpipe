	Sangoma Technologies Inc. announces availability
	 of Alpha-version of Frame Relay implementation
		   for Linux operating system


Alpha version of Sangoma Frame Relay for Linux is now available to
all interested parties.

Frame Relay support for Linux is based on Sangoma's intelligent
multi-protocol Synchronous Data Link Adapters (SDLA) and implemented
as a set of kernel loadable modules allowing users to load drivers
as needed and unload them without re-booting their computers.

Drivers form two-level hierarchy:

 o SDLA driver is responsible for controlling SDLA hardware and
   provides foundation for upper-level protocol-specific drivers
   such as Frame Relay, X.25, PPP, HDLC, SDLC, Bisync, etc.

 o Frame Relay driver (called FLIP) integrates SDLA into Linux
   TCP/IP protocol stack.

Both levels are fully dynamically configurable. 

Following are the key features of Sangoma Frame Relay implementation
for Linux:

 o Support for up to eight SDLA cards.  Different SDLA types can
   be installed in one machine and supported by the same driver. 

 o SDLA driver automatically detects adapter type and performs
   adapter autoconfiguration, where possible.

 o SDLA driver allows to change hardware configuration dynamically,
   without re-linking the kernel, re-booting PC or re-loading the
   driver.

 o Frame Relay driver can be dynamically bound to multiple SDLA
   cards (Frame Relay ports). All Frame Relay ports are
   independently configurable.

 o Linux network interfaces can be created dynamically and assigned
   to particular DLCI's on any Frame Relay port.

can be downloaded from Sangoma's FTP site on the Internet:
